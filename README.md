# roberta-spam-classifer
roBERTa based model for spam classification for [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariumfaheem666/spam-sms-classification-using-nlp) kaggle challenge.

The `main.ipynb` is where everything is housed. I used KNN, Multinominal Naive Bayes, XGBoost, LGBM, and finally fine-tuned a roBERTa model (found in the other ipynb, run through google collab).

I used 3 datasets unique to the kaggle challenge.
